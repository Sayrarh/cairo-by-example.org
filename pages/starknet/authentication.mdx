# Authentication

The `get_caller_address` utility function returns the address that's calling the contract.

An authentication pattern can be implemented by using the `get_caller_address` utility function in combination with `assert`.

## Example

```
%lang starknet

from starkware.cairo.common.cairo_builtins import HashBuiltin
from starkware.starknet.common.syscalls import get_caller_address

# This storage variable is used to keep track of the current owner.
@storage_var
func owner() -> (address : felt):
end

# The owner is set upon contract deployment.
@constructor
func constructor{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(address : felt):
    owner.write(address)
    return ()
end

# A function that should only be accessible by the current owner.
@view
func get_secret{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}() -> (
    secret : felt
):
    only_owner()
    return (42)
end

# Internal function that ensures that the entity calling the contract is the current owner.
func only_owner{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}():
    # Get the current owner via our `owner` storage variable.
    let (current_owner) = owner.read()
    # Get the caller address via the `get_caller_address` utility function.
    let (caller) = get_caller_address()

    # Check that the caller is the current owner.
    assert caller = current_owner

    return ()
end
```
