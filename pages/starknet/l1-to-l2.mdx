# L1 to L2 Communication

StarkNet contracts can receive messages from L1.

Functions annotated with the `@l1_handler` can be called from the "StarkNet Core Contract" deployed by the StarkWare team on L1 by invoking the `sendMessageToL2` function.

A StarkNet contract can have multiple functions annotated with `@l1_handler`. A selector which is a number that uniquely identifies the function name will be used to distinguish between different `@l1_handler`s.

The arguments received by the function annotated with `@l1_handler` are the L1 contract address that sent the message followed by the message elements in the order they were sent.

When calling `sendMessageToL2` on the StarkNet Core Contract on L1, one needs to supply the L2 contract address, the function selector and the payload encoded as an array.

## Example

At first, we need to create our StarkNet contract which has a function annotated with `@l1_handler`:

```
%lang starknet

from starkware.cairo.common.cairo_builtins import HashBuiltin

@storage_var
func sum() -> (result : felt):
end

@view
func get_sum{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}() -> (
    result : felt
):
    let (result) = sum.read()
    return (result)
end

# This is the function that can be called from L1.
@l1_handler
func add{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    from_address : felt, a : felt, b : felt
):
    # Note: It might be useful to check for whitelisted L1 contracts here.

    # We just compute the sum and store it to a storage variable
    #   so that we can inspect it later on.
    sum.write(a + b)

    return ()
end
```

We can use the following Python script to get the selector number for our `@l1_handler` function:

```python
from starkware.starknet.compiler.compile import get_selector_from_name


def main():
    FUNCTION_NAME = "add"
    selector = get_selector_from_name(FUNCTION_NAME)
    print(selector)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Running the script produces the following output:

```sh
1516919092654529690972514611118255134945769636354332808776333403020481942377
```

Next up we can write a Solidity Smart Contract that we'll deploy on L1. This contract uses the StarkNet Core Contract to send our message via `sendMessageToL2` from L1 to L2:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// Interface definition so that we can use the StarkNet Core Contract.
interface IStarknetCore {
    function sendMessageToL2(
        uint256 toAddress,
        uint256 selector,
        uint256[] calldata payload
    ) external returns (bytes32);
}

contract L1ToL2 {
    IStarknetCore starknetCore;

    // This is the selector number we've computed above via our Python script.
    uint256 constant ADD_SELECTOR =
        1516919092654529690972514611118255134945769636354332808776333403020481942377;

    // Set the StarkNet Core Contract upon deployment.
    constructor(IStarknetCore starknetCore_) {
        starknetCore = starknetCore_;
    }

    // The function that will be invoked to send a message to L2.
    // Note: The `l2ContractAddress` is passed-in as an argument.
    function sendMessage(
        uint256 l2ContractAddress,
        uint256 a,
        uint256 b
    ) external {
        // Our payload will be two numbers: `a` and `b`.
        uint256 payloadSize = 2;

        // Create the payload as an in-memory array of length 2
        //  and add the two numbers to the array slots.
        uint256[] memory payload = new uint256[](payloadSize);
        payload[0] = a;
        payload[1] = b;

        // Use the `sendMessageToL2` functionality provided by the
        //  StarkNet Core Contract to send our payload to our `add` function on L2.
        starknetCore.sendMessageToL2(l2ContractAddress, ADD_SELECTOR, payload);
    }
}
```
