# Caller Address

The address that calls the contract function can be obtained via the `get_caller_address` utility function.

## Example

```
%lang starknet

# Import the `get_caller_address` utility function.
from starkware.starknet.common.syscalls import get_caller_address

@view
func get_current_caller_address{syscall_ptr : felt*}() -> (address : felt):
    # `get_caller_address` returns the address that's calling the contract's function.
    let (address) = get_caller_address()
    return (address)
end
```
