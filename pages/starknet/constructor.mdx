# Constructor

Oftentimes it's necessary to initialize a Smart Contract's state upon deployment before public use.

The `@constructor` decorator let's you annotate a function that should be called immediately after the Smart Contract is deployed to StarkNet.

The function annotated with `@constructor` should also be named `constructor`.

Note that it's not possible to call this function ever again.

## Example

```
%lang starknet

from starkware.cairo.common.cairo_builtins import HashBuiltin

@storage_var
func owner() -> (address : felt):
end

# This function will be called immediately after the Smart Contract was deployed to StarkNet.
# It cannot be called again.
# Note that the function name is `constructor`.
@constructor
func constructor{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(address : felt):
    owner.write(address)
    return ()
end

@view
func get_owner{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}() -> (
    address : felt
):
    let (address) = owner.read()
    return (address)
end
```
