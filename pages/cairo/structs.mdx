# Structs

With `struct` one can define arbitrary data types. They are implemented as a continuous list of `felt` values in memory.

Structs can be instantiated via the `new` keyword (note that `new` can't be used with `let`).

Members in structs can be accessed via the dot syntax (e.g. `Foo.bar`).

Struct pointers are implicitly casted to `felt` pointers (e.g. `Foo*` is casted to `felt*`).

## Example

```
# A user-defined Struct called `Point`.
struct Point:
    member x : felt
    member y : felt
end

func get_origin() -> (origin : Point):
    let origin = Point(x=0, y=0)
    return (origin)
end

func main():
    alloc_locals

    # We can't use `let` to create a new `Point` with the `new` keyword...
    # let point_1 = new Point(x=1, y=2)

    # ...but `local` works...
    local point_1 : Point* = new Point(x=1, y=2)
    # ...and so does `tempvar`.
    tempvar point_2 : Point* = new Point(x=3, y=4)

    # To use `let` we can use the following syntax.
    let point_3 = Point(x=5, y=6)

    # Members in structs can be accessed via the `.` syntax.
    assert point_1.x = 1
    assert point_1.y = 2

    # Structs can also be received as return values from functions.
    let (origin) = get_origin()
    assert origin.x = 0
    assert origin.y = 0

    return ()
end
```
