# If / Else

Cairo supports the condition statements `if` and `if ... else`. `else if` statements are currently not supported.

Conditions can be combined with the `and` operator.

In addition to the regular conditional statement one can also use the "Multiplication Trick" to create an inline-if condition statement (conditional ternary operator).

## Example

```
# Importing booleans from Cairos standard library.
from starkware.cairo.common.bool import TRUE, FALSE

func main():
    alloc_locals

    local result

    # `if` statement.
    if 1 == 0:
        result = FALSE
    end

    assert result = TRUE

    # `if` statement with `and`.
    if 1 == 0 and 0 == 1:
        result = FALSE
    end

    assert result = TRUE

    # `if` - `else` statement.
    if 1 == 1:
        result = TRUE
    else:
        result = FALSE
    end

    assert result = TRUE

    # The condition we want to check
    let condition = 1
    # The "Multiplication Trick".
    # `result` will be `0` (false) if `condition` is either `1` or `2`.
    # Note: This trick helps to avoid issues related to Revoked References.
    let result = (condition - 1) * (condition - 2)

    assert result = 0

    return ()
end
```
