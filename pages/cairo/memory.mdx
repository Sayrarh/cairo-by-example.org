# Memory

Memory in Cairo is non-deterministic and read-only:

- Non-deterministic
  - The value for each memory call is chosen by the Prover
- Read-only
  - Once value is written it cannot be changed during program execution

Memory addresses accessed during program execution must be continuous. The order of access doesn't matter, though (e.g. one can access memory at address 1, 3, and 2 before the program terminates).

Gaps in the address range will be filled with arbitrary values by the Prover. This "Gap-filling" will cause inefficiencies as memory is consumed without being used.

## Example

```
from starkware.cairo.common.alloc import alloc

func main():
    # Allocate a new memory segment.
    let (x : felt*) = alloc()

    # Set the value of `x` to 1.
    assert [x] = 1

    # Set the value of `x` to 2.
    # This fails because we already set the value above.
    # assert [x] = 2

    # This succeeds given that we increment the memory address by 1 before assignment.
    # assert [x + 1] = 2

    # Given that the allocation of memory at `x + 1` is commented out we create an inefficiency here...
    assert [x + 2] = 2

    # ...unless we still use the memory at `x + 1` before the program terminates.
    assert [x + 1] = 2

    ret
end
```
