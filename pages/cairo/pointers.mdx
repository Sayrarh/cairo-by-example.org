# Pointers

Pointers are ways to share data structures between Cairo functions.

A pointer points to a memory address and can therefore be used to access the underlying value without passing around the actual value.

Pointers can be identified by the `*` that follows the type declaration (e.g. `tuple*` or `Foo*`).

To create a pointer one can prepend `&` to the variable name (e.g. `&foo`).

## Example

```
struct Point:
    member x : felt
    member y : felt
end

func create_point(x : felt, y : felt) -> (point : Point*):
    # Create a `Point` via the `new` constructor which
    #   returns a pointer to the underlying memory address.
    tempvar point : Point* = new Point(x=x, y=y)

    # Given that `point` is already a pointer there's no
    #   need to write `&point`.
    return (point)
end

func main():
    let (point) = create_point(1, 2)

    assert point.x = 1
    assert point.y = 2

    return ()
end
```
