# Allocating Memory

Cairo supports the creation and storage of objects in memory. Once stored, a pointer to the object is returned which can be used by other functions.

There are 3 different ways to allocate memory:

1. Memory Segment Allocation
   - Via `alloc`
   - Creates an arbitrary length array
2. Single Item Allocation
   - Via `new` operator
   - Initializes the item and returns a pointer to it
3. Local Variables
   - Allocate a variable to retrieve its address

## Example

```
from starkware.cairo.common.alloc import alloc

struct Point:
    member x : felt
    member y : felt
end

func main():
    # `alloc` can be used to allocate new memory segments dynamically.
    # Segments can store a single element...
    let (x : felt*) = alloc()

    # ...or an array.
    let (points_array : Point*) = alloc()
    assert points_array[0] = Point(x=1, y=2)
    assert points_array[1] = Point(x=3, y=4)

    # The `new` operator pushes an object onto the stack and returns a pointer to it.
    tempvar pointer : Point* = new Point(x=1, y=2)
    assert pointer.x = 1
    assert pointer.y = 2

    # `new` can also be used to allocate a fixed-size array using tuples.
    tempvar tuples : felt* = new (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    assert tuples[2] = 3

    return ()
end
```
