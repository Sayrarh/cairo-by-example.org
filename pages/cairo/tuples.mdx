# Tuples

Tuples are an ordered collection of elements. They can consist of any combination of valid types (including Tuples themselves).

Tuples are represented as a comma-separated list of elements enclosed in `()` (e.g. `(1, 2, 3, 4)`).

To distinguish Tuples from regular parenthesis it's necessary to add a trailing comma to single-element Tuples (e.g. `(1,)`).

To access elements within a Tuple one can use the Tuple's index (which starts at `0`) in square brackets.

Nested Tuples can be accessed via additional indices.

## Example

```
func main():
    # Regular Tuple.
    let regular_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

    # Element access in a non-nested Tuple.
    let regular_accessed = regular_tuple[1]
    assert regular_accessed = 2

    # Single-element tuple.
    let single_element_tuple = (1,)
    assert single_element_tuple[0] = 1

    # Nested Tuple.
    let nested_tuple = (1, (2, (3, 4), 5), 6)

    # Element access in a nested Tuple.
    let nested_accessed = nested_tuple[1][1][0]
    assert nested_accessed = 3

    # Tuples can also be used to define types.
    let tuple : (felt, felt) = (1, 2)
    assert tuple[0] = 1
    assert tuple[1] = 2

    # Named tuples can be defined like follows.
    let point : (x : felt, y : felt) = (x=1, y=2)
    assert point[0] = 1
    assert point[1] = 2

    return ()
end
```
